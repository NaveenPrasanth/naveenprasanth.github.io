### **541. Reverse String II**
**Link to Problem:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/)

#### **1. Problem Statement**
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the core task is to modify the string by reversing the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters, starting from the beginning. If there are fewer than `k` characters left at the end, all of them are reversed. If there are between `k` and `2k` characters left, only the first `k` are reversed, and the rest remain unchanged. The output is the modified string.

#### **2. Brute Force Approach**
**Intuition:**
The most straightforward way to conceptualize this is to build the result piece by piece. We can iterate through the string in chunks of `2k`. For each chunk, we identify the part that needs reversal (the first `k` characters) and the part that doesn't (the next `k` characters). We can use string slicing to extract these parts, reverse the necessary segment, and then concatenate them to form a new result string. We must carefully handle the final segment of the string, which might not be a full `2k` characters long.

Since strings are immutable in Python, we would convert the string to a list of characters, perform the slicing and reversal on the list, and then join it back into a string.

**Python Code:**
```python
def reverseStr_brute_force(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    """
    A straightforward approach using list conversion and slicing.
    """
    # In Python, strings are immutable. To modify characters, we must
    # first convert the string to a list, which is a mutable sequence.
    char_list = list(s)
    
    # We iterate through the list in steps of 2*k, as the problem
    # defines the logic based on chunks of this size.
    for i in range(0, len(char_list), 2 * k):
        # Define the segment to be reversed. It starts at `i` and ends at `i+k`.
        start = i
        # The end of the slice might go past the end of the string, but
        # Python's slicing handles this gracefully.
        end = i + k
        
        # Extract the segment that needs to be reversed.
        segment_to_reverse = char_list[start:end]
        
        # Reverse it using Python's convenient slice notation `[::-1]`.
        reversed_segment = segment_to_reverse[::-1]
        
        # Place the reversed segment back into the list.
        char_list[start:end] = reversed_segment

    # Finally, join the characters in the list back into a single string.
    return "".join(char_list)

# Example:
# s = "abcdefg", k = 2
# char_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
# i = 0: reverse char_list[0:2] -> ['b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
# i = 4: reverse char_list[4:6] -> ['b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'e', 'g']
# result: "bacdfeg"
```
**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity: O(N)**, where N is the length of the string. The `range` function steps through the string, ensuring we visit each `2k` block once. The slicing and reversing of a `k`-sized segment takes O(k) time. Since we do this N / (2k) times, the total time for all reversals is `(N / 2k) * O(k) = O(N)`. Converting the string to a list and joining it back also takes O(N).
*   **Space Complexity: O(N)**. We create a list of characters from the string, which requires O(N) space. Furthermore, the slicing operation `segment_to_reverse[::-1]` creates a temporary copy of the segment, though this doesn't change the overall O(N) complexity dominated by the character list.

### **3. Optimized Approach: [Pattern 7: Two Pointers - String Reversal]**
**Intuition:**
While the brute-force approach has an optimal time complexity of O(N), we can refine the *implementation* by performing the reversal **in-place** on our list of characters. This avoids creating temporary copies of slices and directly applies the classic **Two Pointers - String Reversal** pattern.

The overall strategy is the same: iterate through the string in chunks of `2k`. However, instead of using Python's `[::-1]` slicing shortcut to reverse segments, we'll implement the reversal manually with two pointers.

For each segment that needs reversing (i.e., the first `k` characters of a `2k` chunk), we'll do the following:
1.  Initialize a `left` pointer to the start of the segment.
2.  Initialize a `right` pointer to the end of the segment.
3.  While `left` is less than `right`, swap the characters at these pointers.
4.  Move `left` one step to the right and `right` one step to the left.

This process continues until the pointers meet or cross, at which point the segment is fully reversed. The key is to correctly calculate the `right` pointer's initial position to handle the string's edge cases naturally. `right` should be the end of the reversal block (`i + k - 1`) or the end of the string, whichever comes first.

Let's walk through `s = "abcdefg", k = 2`:
-   Convert `s` to `char_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']`.
-   **Iteration 1 (i=0):**
    -   `left` pointer starts at `i = 0`.
    -   `right` pointer starts at `min(0 + 2 - 1, 6) = 1`.
    -   `while left < right`:
        -   `swap(char_list[0], char_list[1])`. List becomes `['b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']`.
        -   `left` becomes 1, `right` becomes 0. Loop terminates.
-   **Iteration 2 (i=4):**
    -   `left` pointer starts at `i = 4`.
    -   `right` pointer starts at `min(4 + 2 - 1, 6) = 5`.
    -   `while left < right`:
        -   `swap(char_list[4], char_list[5])`. List becomes `['b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'e', 'g']`.
        -   `left` becomes 5, `right` becomes 4. Loop terminates.
-   The loop finishes. Join the list to get `"bacdfeg"`.

This in-place swap is the essence of the Two Pointer pattern for reversal.

**Python Code:**
```python
def reverseStr(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    """
    Optimized approach using the Two Pointer pattern for in-place reversal.
    """
    # As before, we need a mutable sequence to perform swaps.
    char_list = list(s)
    
    # Iterate through the string in steps of 2*k.
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2 * k):
        # --- Start of the Two Pointer Pattern ---
        
        # The 'left' pointer always starts at the beginning of the 2k chunk.
        left = i
        
        # The 'right' pointer is at the end of the k-length segment we need to reverse.
        # We use min() to gracefully handle the final chunks of the string:
        # 1. If len(remaining) < k, right will be the last index of the string.
        # 2. If k <= len(remaining) < 2k, right will be i + k - 1.
        right = min(i + k - 1, len(s) - 1)
        
        # Core reversal loop: pointers move towards each other, swapping elements.
        while left < right:
            # Python's tuple unpacking makes the swap clean and efficient.
            char_list[left], char_list[right] = char_list[right], char_list[left]
            
            # Move the pointers inward.
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        
        # --- End of the Two Pointer Pattern ---
            
    # Join the modified list back into a string.
    return "".join(char_list)

```
**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity: O(N)**. This remains the same. The outer loop combined with the inner `while` loop ensures that each character is visited a constant number of times. The `left` and `right` pointers together traverse each `k`-sized segment exactly once.
*   **Space Complexity: O(N)**. In Python, this is unchanged because of string immutability requiring the `char_list` conversion. However, it's important to note that the algorithm *itself* is O(1) in terms of auxiliary space (ignoring the input/output storage). In a language with mutable strings like C++, this exact logic would achieve O(1) space complexity.

#### **4. Pattern Connection**
This problem is a perfect illustration of applying a fundamental pattern—**Two Pointers for Reversal**—as a subroutine to solve a more complex problem.

The key signal for this pattern is any task that requires **reversing a sequence or a subsequence in-place**. While simple string reversal might seem trivial, especially in Python with its slicing syntax, understanding the underlying two-pointer mechanism is critical. Here, the problem isn't just to reverse the whole string, but to repeatedly reverse *specific segments*.

This problem demonstrates that mastery of a pattern isn't just about solving the canonical problem (e.g., "reverse this entire string"), but about recognizing when it can be used as a building block. The characteristics that make this a Two Pointer problem are:
1.  **Core Sub-Problem:** The fundamental operation is reversing a contiguous block of characters.
2.  **In-Place Modification:** The most efficient way to perform this reversal is in-place, which immediately suggests a swapping mechanism.
3.  **Symmetrical Operation:** The swap operation is symmetrical: the first element is swapped with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on, which is the exact motion of two pointers moving towards a center.

By identifying the "reverse this segment" sub-problem, you can immediately map it to the Two Pointers - String Reversal pattern, simplifying the logic and leading to a clean, efficient, and fundamental solution.
