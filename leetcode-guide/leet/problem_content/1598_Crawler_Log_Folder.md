### **1598. Crawler Log Folder**
**Link to Problem:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/)

#### **1. Problem Statement**
Given a list of strings representing operations in a file system, we need to calculate the minimum number of moves to return to the main folder. The operations are: moving to a parent folder (`"../"`), staying in the current folder (`"./"`), or moving to a child folder (`"x/"`). The core task is to simulate this navigation and determine the final "depth" of the file system traversal.

#### **2. Brute Force Approach**
**Intuition:**
The most straightforward way to conceptualize this problem is to literally simulate the folder path. We can use a list or a stack to keep track of the folders in our current path.

1.  Initialize an empty list, say `path_stack`, to represent the directory structure.
2.  Iterate through each `log` in the input list.
3.  If the log is `"../"`, we need to go up one level. This is equivalent to popping the last folder from our `path_stack`, but only if the stack is not already empty (as we can't go higher than the main folder).
4.  If the log is `"./"`, we do nothing; we stay in the same directory.
5.  If the log is anything else (e.g., `"d1/"`), it means we are moving into a child directory. We can push this directory name onto our `path_stack`.
6.  After processing all logs, the size of the `path_stack` represents our final depth. This is the minimum number of `"../"` operations needed to get back to the main folder.

**Python Code:**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations_brute_force(self, logs: List[str]) -> int:
        # We can use a list to act as a stack, simulating the actual path.
        # The final answer is simply the length of this path.
        path_stack = []

        for log in logs:
            if log == "../":
                # If we are not in the main folder (stack is not empty),
                # we move up by popping the last directory.
                if path_stack:
                    path_stack.pop()
            elif log == "./":
                # This operation means "stay in the same folder",
                # so we do nothing to our path.
                continue
            else:
                # This is a move to a child folder.
                # We add the new folder to our path.
                path_stack.append(log)
        
        # The final depth is the number of folders we are inside.
        return len(path_stack)

```
**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity: O(N)**, where N is the number of logs. We iterate through the `logs` list exactly once.
*   **Space Complexity: O(N)**. In the worst-case scenario, every log is a move into a child directory. This would cause our `path_stack` to grow to a size of N, storing N folder names.

### **3. Optimized Approach: State Tracking with a Single Variable**
**Intuition:**
While the stack-based approach correctly simulates the path, it stores more information than we actually need. We don't care about the *names* of the folders in the path (`"d1/"`, `"d2/"`, etc.); we only care about the *depth*.

The key insight is that the problem can be solved by simply tracking a single integer representing our current depth.

1.  Initialize a variable, `depth`, to 0.
2.  Iterate through each `log`:
    *   If the log is `"../"`, we decrement `depth`, but we ensure it never goes below 0.
    *   If the log is `"./"`, we do nothing.
    *   If the log is a child folder (`"x/"`), we increment `depth`.
3.  The final value of `depth` is our answer. This avoids storing the entire path, reducing our space usage significantly.

Let's walk through an example: `logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]`
*   `depth = 0`
*   `"d1/"`: Move in. `depth` becomes 1.
*   `"d2/"`: Move in. `depth` becomes 2.
*   `"../"`: Move out. `depth` becomes 1.
*   `"d21/"`: Move in. `depth` becomes 2.
*   `"./"`: Stay put. `depth` remains 2.

The final depth is 2.

**Python Code:**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, logs: List[str]) -> int:
        # Instead of a stack, we only need to track the depth.
        # This is our state variable.
        depth = 0

        for log in logs:
            if log == "../":
                # Move up one level. We use max(0, ...) to ensure
                # the depth never becomes negative, as we can't go
                # above the main folder.
                depth = max(0, depth - 1)
            elif log == "./":
                # Stay in the current folder, so depth is unchanged.
                continue
            else:
                # Move into a child folder, increasing the depth.
                depth += 1
        
        return depth
```
**Complexity Analysis:**

*   **Time Complexity: O(N)**, where N is the number of logs. We still perform a single pass through the input list.
*   **Space Complexity: O(1)**. This is the crucial improvement. We only use a single integer variable (`depth`) to store our state, regardless of the number of logs.

#### **4. Pattern Connection**
This problem is an excellent example of a **State Simulation** problem, which can often be optimized from a stack-based approach to a simple counter. However, it is important to note that this problem **does not fit the "Two Pointers - String Comparison" pattern.**

The "Two Pointers - String Comparison" pattern is typically used when you need to compare two strings or a single string with itself, where the pointers move based on the characters they encounter. A classic example is **LeetCode 844. Backspace String Compare**. In that problem, you would use two pointers, one for each string, starting from the end. The pointers would move backward, skipping characters that are "deleted" by backspaces (`#`). The pointers' movements are interdependent and used for direct comparison.

In contrast, "Crawler Log Folder" involves processing a sequence of independent operations. There is no complex interaction between different parts of an array or string that would necessitate two pointers. The logic is a simple, linear traversal that updates a single state variable (`depth`). The core task is not comparison but **state management**. Recognizing that you only need to track the final depth, not the full path, is the key optimization and a common theme in problems that can be simplified from a stack simulation to a counter.
