Welcome! I've rebuilt my personal site from the ground up with a cleaner design and a sharper focus.

## What's New

This site now runs on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme. It's fast, minimal, and gets out of the way so the content can speak for itself.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Blog posts** on math, engineering, and machine learning
- A **portfolio** of projects I've built and contributed to
- Occasional deep dives into topics I find interesting

## What's Next

I plan to write more about the systems and models I work with day to day — from backend architecture to probabilistic ML. If any of that sounds interesting, stick around.

Thanks for visiting.
