Hi, I'm **Naveen Prasanth** — a Software and ML Engineer with a focus on backend systems, data pipelines, and machine learning.

## What I Do

I build reliable, scalable software and enjoy working across the stack — from designing APIs and data infrastructure to training and deploying ML models. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of systems engineering and applied machine learning.

## Skills & Interests

- **Languages:** Python, Java, Go, SQL
- **ML/Data:** Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Pandas, Spark
- **Backend:** REST APIs, microservices, distributed systems
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD
- **Interests:** Gaussian processes, probabilistic modeling, systems design

## Beyond Code

I enjoy thinking about math (especially the beauty of irrational numbers), reading about systems design, and exploring new ideas in ML research.
