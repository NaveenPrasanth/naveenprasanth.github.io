I'm a Principal AI Platform Engineer with 9+ years of experience building large-scale, multi-tenant AI systems across healthcare and fintech. I specialize in production-grade LLM platforms, secure RAG pipelines, and real-time agentic systems under strict regulatory controls.

## What I Work On

I lead platform architecture and AI strategy at **Saama Technologies**, where I've built LLM-powered document automation systems for regulated clinical environments. This includes designing RAG pipelines with domain-specific embeddings serving 120+ active clinical users, and HIPAA-compliant multi-tenant architectures processing 1M+ records per cycle.

On the side, I've architected AI platforms as a freelance solutions architect — from an AI avatar + content intelligence platform (**Hypermatter**) to agentic LLM pipelines powering real-time voice ordering (**Valari**), processing 9,000+ live orders.

## Education

- **M.Tech in AI and Machine Learning** — BITS Pilani (2023–2025)
  - Thesis: *Standardizing Protocol Documentation Using Clinical Ontologies and Conversational AI*
- **B.Tech in Computer Science** — Pondicherry Engineering College (2013–2017)

## Community

I'm a co-founder of **Build2Learn**, a monthly developer community focused on rapid, one-day collaborative project builds. I also speak at meetups and GNU/Linux User Groups.
